        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org is a research project led by the SMART Infrastructure Facility, University of Wollongong in collaboration with the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) and Twitter Inc. The Joint Pilot Study for the project was operationally active from December 2014 to March 2015; during this time, the project enabled Jakarta’s citizens to report the locations of flood events using the social media network Twitter, thereby contributing to a publicly accessible real-time map of flood conditions at PetaJakarta.org. These data were used by BPBD DKI Jakarta to cross-validate formal reports of flooding from traditional data sources, supporting the creation of information for flood assessment, response, and management in real-time. This white paper provides a description of the PetaJakarta.org research project from both citizen and government perspectives and reports on the results of the Joint Pilot Study to evaluate of the project. At the time of publication, the project has entered its second phase—Operational Integration and Technology Transfer—as part of the ongoing collaboration between the SMART Infrastructure Facility, BPBD DKI Jakarta, and Twitter Inc.</p>

        <p class="paper">Through its integration in BPBD DKI Jakarta’s existing disaster risk management (DRM) information ecosystem, the PetaJakarta.org project has proven the value and utility of social media as a mega-city methodology for crowd-sourcing relevant situational information to aid in decision-making and response coordination during extreme weather events. PetaJakarta.org is a promising evolution within the DRM information ecosystem because it leverages both the inherent capabilities within ubiquitous mobile devices (i.e. GNSS-enabled messaging) and the network capabilities of social media through free and open source software (FOSS) to provide validated and actionable information for citizens and government agencies, thereby improving situational knowledge and increasing response times in disaster scenarios. To maintain resilience within this information ecosystem, the study emphasizes the need for access to data via open application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable the integration of vulnerability information and potential hazard exposure to facilitate integrated risk evaluation and assessment.</p>
        <p class="paper">For residents of Jakarta, PetaJakarta.org enabled autonomous users to make independant decisions on safey and navigation in response to the flood in real-time, thereby helping increase the resilience of the city’s residents to flooding and its attendant difficulties. Critically, this outcome was achieved using the same data and map that was used by the government; designing the platform to meet the needs of citizen-users and government agencies enables and promotes civic co-management as a strategy for climate adaptation. This social strategy is underpinned by the open source software CogniCity, a framework for urban data that anyone is free to inspect, download, and redesign; this open source ethos and the transparency it facilitates was critical to the success of the Joint Pilot Study.</p>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org has demonstrated social media’s valuable niche within the disaster risk management information ecosystem; as an operational tool capable of providing decision support at the various spatial and temporal scales required by the different actors within city, PetaJakarta.org offers an innovative and inexpensive method for the crowdsourcing of time-critical situational information in disaster scenarios.</p>

        <h3>1.0 Overview of PetaJakarta.org</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="paper">In this section, we provide a general overview of the PetaJakarta.org Joint Pilot Study and offer preliminary explanations of the method, software, and relevant infrastructure in Jakarta, Indonesia. While Jakarta is not unique in facing severe flooding during the seasonal monsoon in Asia, it is an ideal case study for the development of open source software to support crowdsourcing of time-critical situational information during extreme weather events. First, Jakarta’s government has embraced social media as a means to communicate with residents; in fact, the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency has a strong mandate to improve communication with the public through social media. Second, the Jakarta government has already actively endorsed and supported the development of open data projects (such as the extensive district mapping conducted by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, discussed further in section 4.1.3). Third, Jakarta has an extremely high proportion of mobile phone users and one of the highest concentrations of Twitter users in the world; because the PetaJakarta.org project relies on densely populated urban environments with high proportions of social media users, Jakarta provides an especially compelling environment for understanding the value of social media in a disaster risk management context. The scalability and transferability of lessons learned from Jakarta is discussed in further detail below (see especially sections 6.1 and 6.2).</p>

        <h4>1.1 Project Summary</h4>
        <p class="subsection">1.1.1 PetaJakarta.org</p>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org is a world-first Joint Pilot Study initiated by the SMART Infrastructure Facility, University of Wollongong, in collaboration with the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) and Twitter Inc. The study aims to research and develop open source software (OSS) for the integrated management of social media and API-sourced data<sup>1</sup> in order to make risk information open, accessible, and actionable by residents, government agencies, NGOs, and private sector developers. PetaJakarta.org runs on the OSS CogniCity, a framework for urban data collection and management developed by the SMART Infrastructure Facility and the SMART OSGeo Lab; released as OSS, CogniCity can readily be deployed in other urban environments in Indonesia and Southeast Asia facing similar challenges. As rates of urbanization continue to increase in Asia [<a href="#fig01">Fig. 01</a>], it is imperative to develop tools that can facilitate the co-management of increasingly complex urban environments. With more than fourteen megacities located on deltas in the region [<a href="#fig02">Fig. 02</a>], hundreds of millions of urban residents will face difficult challenges due to extreme weather events as a result of climate change (<a href="#IPCC2014">IPCC 2014</a>); using the power of social media to network and validate time-critical situational information offers a key element for resilience to extreme weather events. PetaJakarta.org is the first pilot study to prove the value of integrated social media and API-sourced data for the civic co-management of disasters resulting from extreme weather events in a major Southeast Asian megacity.</p>
        <!--footnote one-->
        <p class="paper" style="font-size:12px;"><sup>1</sup>API refers to Application Programming Interface, or the means by which ‘machine-to-machine’ communication occurs between computer programs automatically, without the aid of human agents.</p>

        <p class="paper">The pilot project for CogniCity was sited in Jakarta for several key reasons. Jakarta, with its surrounding conurbation of Jabodatabek, has the highest rate of urbanization in the world and comprises the second-largest contiguous settlement on earth. With a greater metropolitan area hosting 13 rivers, 1100 kilometers of canals, seasonal monsoon flood events, and over 28 million residents, Jakarta is a key case study for the development of improved risk management through new tools and open source software. Open source software solutions are critical in Jakarta because cost-prohibitive private products remain unrealistic as solutions under current budget constraints. In Jakarta, risk information and coordination through open data protocols is critical to support decision-making about disaster response, emergency planning, and community resilience. Furthermore, rich suites of open and accessible geospatial risk data generate activity in NGOs and the private sector, especially for longer term disaster risk management planning tools, such as InaSAFE (developed by the Australian-Indonesian Facility for Disaster Reduction), and economic calculators such as JakSAFE (developed by the World Bank). The development of social media and application-driven data collection via mobile devices allows for unprecedented data collection capacities; in order to be effective, these technologies require coordination through robust, enterprise-grade open source software.</p>
        <p class="paper">BPBD DKI Jakarta is regularly faced with the difficult challenge of anticipating and responding to floods hazards and related extreme weather events in Jakarta. As a research partner, the organization allowed PetaJakarta.org invaluable access to their operations through a process of co-research and institutional ethnography. By carefully studying the operational procedures, concerns, and ambitions of the Agency, the project developed tools that could be integrated effectively into the existing structure of the organization and its various data flowlines, and transferred incrementally over the course of the research collaboration, thereby ensuring an efficient strategy for both development and implementation.</p>
        <p class="paper">Twitter was selected as the ideal social media platform for the Joint Pilot Study because Jakarta has one of the highest concentrations of Twitter users in the world. Additionally, a Twitter #DataGrant gave the research team unprecedented access to a suite of historical data about flooding in Jakarta, thus allowing the system to be developed and calibrated with large data sets, thereby ensuring its operative functionality during the actual monsoon season in 2014-2015. Finally, by working in close collaboration with Twitter, the project benefitted from the advice and mentorship of a group of media experts, engineers, and advocates who were all critical to the overall success of the project.</p>

        <p class="subsection">1.1.2 GeoSocial Intelligence Framework</p>
        <p class="paper">While social media has heralded a number of studies regarding its potential application for scientific research and civic governance, the movement from social media to “GeoSocial Intelligence” (<a href="#Holderness2014">Holderness 2014</a>) relies on a more comprehensive understanding of the information ecosystem within which social media operates. According to <a href="#Easterling2014">Easterling (2014: 17)</a>, “Between 2000 and 2013, the global number of cell phone subscriptions went from 740 million to 6.8 billion phones with over three-quarters of phones in the developing world.” An ever-increasing number of these mobile devices are built with Global Navigation Satellite  System (GNSS)-functionalities (e.g. GPS), thus allowing for the scientific study of GNSS-located data, frequently shared via social media platforms. The “intelligence” in such a configuration is not immediate; extracting knowledge from the “noise” of social media requires designed engagement and filtering processes to eliminate unwanted information, reward valuable reports, and display useful data in a manner that further enables users, governments, or other agencies to make non-trivial, actionable decisions in a time-critical manner. Thus, a GeoSocial Intelligence Framework depends on four basic principles: 1) develop reliable, free and open source software (FOSS) that enables the gathering, sorting, and display of useful disaster-related information; 2) move from passive spatial and temporal data mining techniques to “big crowdsourcing,” wherein users on a social media platform are actively encouraged to share information relevant to a given situation or anticipated scenario; 3) promote an ethic of co-management that values the peer-to-peer sharing of situational information within the same platform that is used by government agencies and first responders, who can transparently monitor and cross-check the data being shared; 4) make the data open, so that all users can inspect the software, review the system, and develop complementary tools and technologies that further enhance resilience within the information ecosystem.</p>
        <p class="paper">The value of social media as a critical tool in the disaster emergency management toolkit has be proven by a number of previous studies (<a href="#Meier2014">Meier 2014</a>); the move from social media to GeoSocial Intelligence is an especially promising evolution of this prior research and software development. While the utility of passively-mined social media data can offer insights for offline analytics and derivative studies for future planning scenarios, the critical issue for frontline emergency responders is the organization and coordination of actionable, real-time data related to disaster situations. From this perspective, GeoSocial Intelligence can be reasonably understood as a promising evolution within the disaster risk management information ecosystem because it leverages both the inherent capabilities within ubiquitous mobile devices (i.e. GNSS-enabled messaging) and the network capabilities of social media, through OSS to provide validated and actionable information for citizens and government agencies, thereby improving situational knowledge and increasing response times in disaster scenarios.</p>
        <p class="subsection">1.1.3 CogniCity</p>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org is the pilot project for the OSS CogniCity, developed at the SMART Infrastructure Facility as an open framework for urban data collection and analysis. The objective of this OSS is to remove redundancies in the study and promotion of urban resilience to extreme weather events as a result of climate change; the elimination of redundancies occurs because CogniCity can be used simultaneously to study patterns and practices of resilience among users and government agencies, and to enable more effective sharing of information between citizens, government agencies, and NGOs. At the time of writing, CogniCity is the only fully developed and tested OSS platform that uses a GeoSocial Intelligence Approach to urban data collection, analysis, and sharing. Such a system has a wide variety of applications for civic co-management as a strategy for adaptation to climate change, not least because the OSS is designed from first principles to be transferable among various domains of application (such as other weather-related hazards, waste management, or crime) and other geographies and languages.</p>

        <h4>1.2 Fluid Geographies of the Coastal Megacity</h4>
        <p class="subsection">1.2.1 Flooding in Jakarta</p>
        <p class="paper">The coastal megacity of Jakarta experiences annual flooding during the seasonal monsoon which seriously affects human life, property, and urban infrastructure (<a href="#Hartono2010">Hartono et al. 2010</a>). The city is situated on a coastal deltaic plain served by 13 rivers which flow from the mountains in the south, northwards through the city to the Java sea [<a href="#fig03">Fig. 03</a>]. Over forty percent of the city is at or below sea level, necessitating a complex system of hydraulic and hydrological infrastructure to manage the movement of water through the city (Hartono et al. 2010). The rapid urbanisation and population explosion seen in Jakarta over the past decade (<a href="#Li2003">Li 2003</a>) has diminished natural surface infiltration, increased ground subsidence, and added additional stress on the deteriorating hydrological infrastructure, increasing the city’s exposure and vulnerability to flooding (<a href="#Hallegatte2013">Hallegatte et al. 2013</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">Importantly, however, flooding can no longer be seen as a “natural” event; as anthropogenic climate change interacts with the urban environment in increasingly unpredictable ways, the complex urban environment and its technical systems for the management of weather-related hazards is as much a part of the monsoon ecology as the precipitation itself. According to the renown philosopher of technology <a href="#Nancy2015">Jean-Luc Nancy (2015: 3-4)</a>, “From now on there is an interconnection, an intertwining, even a symbiosis of technologies, exchanges, movements, which makes it so that a flood—for instance—wherever it may occur, must necessarily involve relationships with any number of technical, social, economic, political intricacies that keep us from regarding it simply as a misadventure or a misfortune whose consequences can be more or less easily circumscribed.” Understanding these changing dynamics may mean giving up on expensive, “blackbox” (<a href="#Townsend2014">Townsend 2014: 88</a>) predictive flood models, which have proven ineffective as tools for preparedness and response.</p>

        <p class="subsection">1.2.2 Regional Perspectives on Flood Management</p>
        <p class="paper">Cities are constantly evolving into more complex systems of interconnected infrastructure and people; as a consequence, many coastal cities become increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of severe weather events and global climate change (<a href="#Walsh2011">Walsh et al. 2011</a>). Insight into the resilience of these urban systems and the effects of failing infrastructure in such events is crucial to the understanding of a city’s ability to adapt to climate change (<a href="Rosenzweig2011">Rosenzweig 2011</a>). This knowledge is particularly significant in the developing nations of Southeast Asia, which are expected to experience the greatest impacts of climate change, yet are often unable to make informed, evidence-based decisions concerning infrastructure and urban planning due to a lack of resources and an absence of reliable or consistent data (<a href="#Paar2011">Paar & Rekittke 2011</a>).</p>
        <p class="subsection">1.2.3 Regional Perspectives on Social Media</p>
        <p class="paper">The rise of social media platforms has taken city planners by surprise because these technologies not only provide unprecedented volumes of data relevant to the analysis of urban systems, but, more fundamentally, they change the way residents interact with each other and with the city at large (<a href="Townsend2014">Townsend 2014</a>). As first adopters continue to expedite the uptake of social media in Asian megacities, it is imperative to understand how to best harness the power of networked communication technologies to overcome urban challenges that result from climate change. Because geospatial information derived from social media is especially valuable and actionable within dense urban environments with a high proportion of networked users, Asian megacities facing the combined challenge of rapid development and climate change are critical sites for the development of new OSS that can turn the noise of social media into intelligent, actionable insights for users and governments alike.</p>

        <h4>1.3 Infrastructure Overview in Indonesia</h4>
        <p class="subsection">1.3.1 Jakarta’s Flood Infrastructure: A General History</p>
        <p class="paper">Seasonal flooding has been a part of life in Jakarta since the seventeenth century. By 1850, the Dutch colonial government finally took action and established the Burgelijke Openbare Werke, a task force responsible for flooding in the colonial city of Batavia. Following the major flood of 1918, an integrated master plan was designed to prevent further flooding; the West Flood Canal was built under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Herman van Breen. Later, under Soekarno’s administration, Waduk Pluit, Waduk Setiabudi, Waduk Tomang and Waduk Grogol were all successfully constructed as part of Kopro Banjir project. Following these infrastructural measures to combat flooding, Soeharto then planned to widen the canal in 1973, but the project failed to launch. Instead, the central government and local governments built the Cengkareng Drainage System as a flood control network that was finished a decade later. Despite these efforts, the flood infrastructure was unable to protect Jakarta as major floods paralyzed the city in 1979, 1996, 1999 and 2002. The Indonesian government, under Megawati’s administration, initiated the East Flood Canal as an extension of the original design by van Breen; its construction was completed under Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s government, costing over 4.9 trillion Rupiah (US$ 373 million). Notably, as in many other countries hit by the 1997 financial crisis, Indonesia’s infrastructure has also suffered from underinvestment for over a decade; flood management infrastructure has been seriously affected.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paper">The most recent strategy employed to fight flooding, initiated by the central government, is the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development program (NCICD). NCICD is supported by the government of The Netherlands, DKI Jakarta, and the government of Indonesia. The plan is to create an outer sea wall, the investment costs for which will be recovered by selling properties of a new waterfront city built on reclaimed land (<a href="#NCICD2014">NCICD 2014</a>). The NCICD project, also known colloquially as Great Garuda Sea Wall, has attracted various controversies (<a href="#Noviansyah2015">Noviansyah 2015</a>). Some see this solution as too profit-oriented and argue that the sea wall would lead to a “giant sewerage system” given that rivers and canals are highly polluted and would effectively drain the sewage of millions of residents into a giant retention pond on the coast, behind the proposed sea wall. There are also criticisms regarding the possible damage to the local marine ecology and fisheries, as seen during the development of the Saemangeum Sea Wall in South Korea (<a href="#Lighthouse2006">Lighthouse Foundation 2006</a>). In addition, many in the public doubt the feasibility of the project as Public Private Partnership (PPP) because such schemes are relatively new in Indonesia, and because the country has seen numerous infrastructure failures due to poor project execution and corruption (Noviansyah 2015).</p>
        <p class="paper">The Jakarta government is also currently undertaking a “Normalization” project aimed at increasing the drainage capacity of waterways, such as Ciliwung River. The project will displace over 34,000 families living along the river bank and widen Ciliwung river to almost double its natural width (<a href="#Rujak2008">Rujak Center 2008</a>). The measurement of sedimentation in surrounding channels and the Ciliwung River suggests that normalization could damage ecology and fisheries in ways similar to that of the Saemangeum Sea Wall in South Korea (<a href="#Smith2015">Smith 2015</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">As the population of Jakarta, and the surrounding area of Jabodetabek, continues to  expand, the impacts of flooding are significantly heightened. The 1996 flood forced 30,000 people to evacuate; the flood in 2007 inundated houses of 320,000 residents and claimed the lives of 80 people (<a href="#Taufik2014">Taufik 2014</a>). At present, 72.7% of Jakarta is prone to flooding (<a href="#Rostanti2012">Rostanti 2014</a>), threatening the lives of over 983,399 residents, or 10.2% of Jakarta’s population, with residents in North Jakarta facing the highest risk (<a href="#Rostanti2012">Rostanti 2014</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">Although Jakarta is the main urban area affected by flooding, the hydrological problem can be traced all the way to Bogor, 60 kilometers south of Jakarta. There are 13 major rivers running through Jakarta; most of these rivers originate in the mountainous areas of Bogor. Regrettably, the natural catchment areas of Bogor are decreasing due to weak land use policy enforcement. For example, based on Regional Regulation No. 19 / 2008, Kampung Sukatani is a conservation area and therefore construction in this area is prohibited; however, Kampung Sukatani has been transformed into an area of extremely luxurious residences. The villas were forcefully demolished by the Bogor government (with funding from the Jakarta government) in 2013, only to be rebuilt again two years later (<a href="#Rahmawati2015">Rahmawati 2015</a>). Examples like these show the need for an enduring commitment on the part of the governments of Bogor and Jakarta to manage the root causes of flooding upstream, where land use changes have serious effects on the ability of the downstream hydrological system to cope with the annual monsoon rains.</p>
        <p class="subsection">1.3.2 The Future of Flood Infrastructure in Jakarta</p>
        <p class="paper">The history of investment in flood infrastructure in Jakarta tends to suggest that new infrastructure rarely guarantees a reasonable cost-benefit analysis; research also suggests that the government should commit to a thorough analysis of all existing facilities and assets to develop an operational overview, in addition to investing in new infrastructure and additional maintenance. In the 2014 Regional Budget, the government allocated as little as 0.0153%, or 750 billion IDR, for flood control systems and drainage maintenance. With such a modest investment in the maintenance of critical flood infrastructure, it is not surprising that before monsoon season of 2012, for example, it was discovered that 141 out of 555 pumps in Jakarta were not operational (<a href="#Kompas2014">Kompas 2014</a>). While infrastructure asset analysis is a relatively novel science, it is nevertheless critical for the Jakarta government to devote resources to assessments and maintenance in order to determine the current state of flood control infrastructure and to make evidence-based, targeted investments in new facilities that can reduce risk in the weakest aspects of the current system. Because infrastructure facilities do not exist individually and are highly interdependent (<a href="#Ebrahimy2014">Ebrahimy 2014</a>; <a href="#Tran2014">Tran et al. 2014</a>), functional failures in one flood management facility can make any attempt to add new components to the system difficult to plan. Decisions regarding critical flood infrastructure investment should be evidence-based and rely on an understanding of critical interdependencies, energy demands, and an integrated assessment of needs in all related sectors because infrastructure interdependencies bring with them layers of complexity, uncertainty, and risk to urban planning and design (<a href="#Tran2014">Tran et al. 2014</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">From one administration to another, the most common approach toward flood infrastructure in Jakarta is to focus on new physical construction. Not only are these ventures capital intensive, but projects with large construction budgets are also prone to corruption (<a href="#Yanto2010">Yanto, 2010</a>). Currently, information and communication technologies (ICT) are a neglected dimension of flood management infrastructure. With such a high rate of mobile phone penetration, and exceedingly high rates of social media usage, the Jakarta government is well-positioned to encourage greater public participation in infrastructure monitoring and flood event reporting; these elements of civic co-management could help alleviate much of the burden currently carried borne solely by the government. However, such an approach requires a new vision of infrastructure that goes beyond canals and pumps, and begins to approach the question of flood management from a holistic view that includes ICT and public utilities for flood reporting.</p>
        <p class="paper">As a compliment to increased ICT investment, open data allows universal participation where data is available as a whole and and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost. By providing data under terms that permit reuse and redistribution, including intermixing with other datasets, citizen-users, NGOs, student and advocacy groups, and private developers can generate new tools for information management within the application economy. One excellent example of a government innovation to promote open data is the recently released SmartCity Jakarta website, with its applications Qlue (public) and Crop (government use only). Further investment in projects like SmartCity Jakarta, and the API-enabled data they produce, would be a welcome element to the DRM information ecosystem.</p>
