        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org is a research project led by the SMART Infrastructure Facility, University of Wollongong in collaboration with the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) and Twitter Inc. The Joint Pilot Study for the project was operationally active from December 2014 to March 2015; during this time, the project enabled Jakarta’s citizens to report the locations of flood events using the social media network Twitter, thereby contributing to a publicly accessible real-time map of flood conditions at PetaJakarta.org. These data were used by BPBD DKI Jakarta to cross-validate formal reports of flooding from traditional data sources, supporting the creation of information for flood assessment, response, and management in real-time. This white paper provides a description of the PetaJakarta.org research project from both citizen and government perspectives and reports on the results of the Joint Pilot Study to evaluate of the project. At the time of publication, the project has entered its second phase—Operational Integration and Technology Transfer—as part of the ongoing collaboration between the SMART Infrastructure Facility, BPBD DKI Jakarta, and Twitter Inc.</p>

        <p class="paper">Through its integration in BPBD DKI Jakarta’s existing disaster risk management (DRM) information ecosystem, the PetaJakarta.org project has proven the value and utility of social media as a mega-city methodology for crowd-sourcing relevant situational information to aid in decision-making and response coordination during extreme weather events. PetaJakarta.org is a promising evolution within the DRM information ecosystem because it leverages both the inherent capabilities within ubiquitous mobile devices (i.e. GNSS-enabled messaging) and the network capabilities of social media through free and open source software (FOSS) to provide validated and actionable information for citizens and government agencies, thereby improving situational knowledge and increasing response times in disaster scenarios. To maintain resilience within this information ecosystem, the study emphasizes the need for access to data via open application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable the integration of vulnerability information and potential hazard exposure to facilitate integrated risk evaluation and assessment.</p>
        <p class="paper">For residents of Jakarta, PetaJakarta.org enabled autonomous users to make independant decisions on safey and navigation in response to the flood in real-time, thereby helping increase the resilience of the city’s residents to flooding and its attendant difficulties. Critically, this outcome was achieved using the same data and map that was used by the government; designing the platform to meet the needs of citizen-users and government agencies enables and promotes civic co-management as a strategy for climate adaptation. This social strategy is underpinned by the open source software CogniCity, a framework for urban data that anyone is free to inspect, download, and redesign; this open source ethos and the transparency it facilitates was critical to the success of the Joint Pilot Study.</p>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org has demonstrated social media’s valuable niche within the disaster risk management information ecosystem; as an operational tool capable of providing decision support at the various spatial and temporal scales required by the different actors within city, PetaJakarta.org offers an innovative and inexpensive method for the crowdsourcing of time-critical situational information in disaster scenarios.</p>

        <h3>1.0 Overview of PetaJakarta.org</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="paper">In this section, we provide a general overview of the PetaJakarta.org Joint Pilot Study and offer preliminary explanations of the method, software, and relevant infrastructure in Jakarta, Indonesia. While Jakarta is not unique in facing severe flooding during the seasonal monsoon in Asia, it is an ideal case study for the development of open source software to support crowdsourcing of time-critical situational information during extreme weather events. First, Jakarta’s government has embraced social media as a means to communicate with residents; in fact, the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency has a strong mandate to improve communication with the public through social media. Second, the Jakarta government has already actively endorsed and supported the development of open data projects (such as the extensive district mapping conducted by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, discussed further in section 4.1.3). Third, Jakarta has an extremely high proportion of mobile phone users and one of the highest concentrations of Twitter users in the world; because the PetaJakarta.org project relies on densely populated urban environments with high proportions of social media users, Jakarta provides an especially compelling environment for understanding the value of social media in a disaster risk management context. The scalability and transferability of lessons learned from Jakarta is discussed in further detail below (see especially sections 6.1 and 6.2).</p>

        <h4>1.1 Project Summary</h4>
        <p class="subsection">1.1.1 PetaJakarta.org</p>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org is a world-first Joint Pilot Study initiated by the SMART Infrastructure Facility, University of Wollongong, in collaboration with the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) and Twitter Inc. The study aims to research and develop open source software (OSS) for the integrated management of social media and API-sourced data<sup>1</sup> in order to make risk information open, accessible, and actionable by residents, government agencies, NGOs, and private sector developers. PetaJakarta.org runs on the OSS CogniCity, a framework for urban data collection and management developed by the SMART Infrastructure Facility and the SMART OSGeo Lab; released as OSS, CogniCity can readily be deployed in other urban environments in Indonesia and Southeast Asia facing similar challenges. As rates of urbanization continue to increase in Asia [<a href="#fig01">Fig. 01</a>], it is imperative to develop tools that can facilitate the co-management of increasingly complex urban environments. With more than fourteen megacities located on deltas in the region [<a href="#fig02">Fig. 02</a>], hundreds of millions of urban residents will face difficult challenges due to extreme weather events as a result of climate change (<a href="#IPCC2014">IPCC 2014</a>); using the power of social media to network and validate time-critical situational information offers a key element for resilience to extreme weather events. PetaJakarta.org is the first pilot study to prove the value of integrated social media and API-sourced data for the civic co-management of disasters resulting from extreme weather events in a major Southeast Asian megacity.</p>
        <!--footnote one-->
        <p class="paper" style="font-size:12px;"><sup>1</sup>API refers to Application Programming Interface, or the means by which ‘machine-to-machine’ communication occurs between computer programs automatically, without the aid of human agents.</p>

        <p class="paper">The pilot project for CogniCity was sited in Jakarta for several key reasons. Jakarta, with its surrounding conurbation of Jabodatabek, has the highest rate of urbanization in the world and comprises the second-largest contiguous settlement on earth. With a greater metropolitan area hosting 13 rivers, 1100 kilometers of canals, seasonal monsoon flood events, and over 28 million residents, Jakarta is a key case study for the development of improved risk management through new tools and open source software. Open source software solutions are critical in Jakarta because cost-prohibitive private products remain unrealistic as solutions under current budget constraints. In Jakarta, risk information and coordination through open data protocols is critical to support decision-making about disaster response, emergency planning, and community resilience. Furthermore, rich suites of open and accessible geospatial risk data generate activity in NGOs and the private sector, especially for longer term disaster risk management planning tools, such as InaSAFE (developed by the Australian-Indonesian Facility for Disaster Reduction), and economic calculators such as JakSAFE (developed by the World Bank). The development of social media and application-driven data collection via mobile devices allows for unprecedented data collection capacities; in order to be effective, these technologies require coordination through robust, enterprise-grade open source software.</p>
        <p class="paper">BPBD DKI Jakarta is regularly faced with the difficult challenge of anticipating and responding to floods hazards and related extreme weather events in Jakarta. As a research partner, the organization allowed PetaJakarta.org invaluable access to their operations through a process of co-research and institutional ethnography. By carefully studying the operational procedures, concerns, and ambitions of the Agency, the project developed tools that could be integrated effectively into the existing structure of the organization and its various data flowlines, and transferred incrementally over the course of the research collaboration, thereby ensuring an efficient strategy for both development and implementation.</p>
        <p class="paper">Twitter was selected as the ideal social media platform for the Joint Pilot Study because Jakarta has one of the highest concentrations of Twitter users in the world. Additionally, a Twitter #DataGrant gave the research team unprecedented access to a suite of historical data about flooding in Jakarta, thus allowing the system to be developed and calibrated with large data sets, thereby ensuring its operative functionality during the actual monsoon season in 2014-2015. Finally, by working in close collaboration with Twitter, the project benefitted from the advice and mentorship of a group of media experts, engineers, and advocates who were all critical to the overall success of the project.</p>

        <p class="subsection">1.1.2 GeoSocial Intelligence Framework</p>
        <p class="paper">While social media has heralded a number of studies regarding its potential application for scientific research and civic governance, the movement from social media to “GeoSocial Intelligence” (<a href="#Holderness2014">Holderness 2014</a>) relies on a more comprehensive understanding of the information ecosystem within which social media operates. According to <a href="#Easterling2014">Easterling (2014: 17)</a>, “Between 2000 and 2013, the global number of cell phone subscriptions went from 740 million to 6.8 billion phones with over three-quarters of phones in the developing world.” An ever-increasing number of these mobile devices are built with Global Navigation Satellite  System (GNSS)-functionalities (e.g. GPS), thus allowing for the scientific study of GNSS-located data, frequently shared via social media platforms. The “intelligence” in such a configuration is not immediate; extracting knowledge from the “noise” of social media requires designed engagement and filtering processes to eliminate unwanted information, reward valuable reports, and display useful data in a manner that further enables users, governments, or other agencies to make non-trivial, actionable decisions in a time-critical manner. Thus, a GeoSocial Intelligence Framework depends on four basic principles: 1) develop reliable, free and open source software (FOSS) that enables the gathering, sorting, and display of useful disaster-related information; 2) move from passive spatial and temporal data mining techniques to “big crowdsourcing,” wherein users on a social media platform are actively encouraged to share information relevant to a given situation or anticipated scenario; 3) promote an ethic of co-management that values the peer-to-peer sharing of situational information within the same platform that is used by government agencies and first responders, who can transparently monitor and cross-check the data being shared; 4) make the data open, so that all users can inspect the software, review the system, and develop complementary tools and technologies that further enhance resilience within the information ecosystem.</p>
        <p class="paper">The value of social media as a critical tool in the disaster emergency management toolkit has be proven by a number of previous studies (<a href="#Meier2014">Meier 2014</a>); the move from social media to GeoSocial Intelligence is an especially promising evolution of this prior research and software development. While the utility of passively-mined social media data can offer insights for offline analytics and derivative studies for future planning scenarios, the critical issue for frontline emergency responders is the organization and coordination of actionable, real-time data related to disaster situations. From this perspective, GeoSocial Intelligence can be reasonably understood as a promising evolution within the disaster risk management information ecosystem because it leverages both the inherent capabilities within ubiquitous mobile devices (i.e. GNSS-enabled messaging) and the network capabilities of social media, through OSS to provide validated and actionable information for citizens and government agencies, thereby improving situational knowledge and increasing response times in disaster scenarios.</p>
        <p class="subsection">1.1.3 CogniCity</p>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org is the pilot project for the OSS CogniCity, developed at the SMART Infrastructure Facility as an open framework for urban data collection and analysis. The objective of this OSS is to remove redundancies in the study and promotion of urban resilience to extreme weather events as a result of climate change; the elimination of redundancies occurs because CogniCity can be used simultaneously to study patterns and practices of resilience among users and government agencies, and to enable more effective sharing of information between citizens, government agencies, and NGOs. At the time of writing, CogniCity is the only fully developed and tested OSS platform that uses a GeoSocial Intelligence Approach to urban data collection, analysis, and sharing. Such a system has a wide variety of applications for civic co-management as a strategy for adaptation to climate change, not least because the OSS is designed from first principles to be transferable among various domains of application (such as other weather-related hazards, waste management, or crime) and other geographies and languages.</p>

        <h4>1.2 Fluid Geographies of the Coastal Megacity</h4>
        <p class="subsection">1.2.1 Flooding in Jakarta</p>
        <p class="paper">The coastal megacity of Jakarta experiences annual flooding during the seasonal monsoon which seriously affects human life, property, and urban infrastructure (<a href="#Hartono2010">Hartono et al. 2010</a>). The city is situated on a coastal deltaic plain served by 13 rivers which flow from the mountains in the south, northwards through the city to the Java sea [<a href="#fig03">Fig. 03</a>]. Over forty percent of the city is at or below sea level, necessitating a complex system of hydraulic and hydrological infrastructure to manage the movement of water through the city (<a href="#Hartono2010">Hartono et al. 2010</a>). The rapid urbanisation and population explosion seen in Jakarta over the past decade (<a href="#Li2003">Li 2003</a>) has diminished natural surface infiltration, increased ground subsidence, and added additional stress on the deteriorating hydrological infrastructure, increasing the city’s exposure and vulnerability to flooding (<a href="#Hallegatte2013">Hallegatte et al. 2013</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">Importantly, however, flooding can no longer be seen as a “natural” event; as anthropogenic climate change interacts with the urban environment in increasingly unpredictable ways, the complex urban environment and its technical systems for the management of weather-related hazards is as much a part of the monsoon ecology as the precipitation itself. According to the renown philosopher of technology <a href="#Nancy2015">Jean-Luc Nancy (2015: 3-4)</a>, “From now on there is an interconnection, an intertwining, even a symbiosis of technologies, exchanges, movements, which makes it so that a flood—for instance—wherever it may occur, must necessarily involve relationships with any number of technical, social, economic, political intricacies that keep us from regarding it simply as a misadventure or a misfortune whose consequences can be more or less easily circumscribed.” Understanding these changing dynamics may mean giving up on expensive, “blackbox” (<a href="#Townsend2014">Townsend 2014: 88</a>) predictive flood models, which have proven ineffective as tools for preparedness and response.</p>

        <p class="subsection">1.2.2 Regional Perspectives on Flood Management</p>
        <p class="paper">Cities are constantly evolving into more complex systems of interconnected infrastructure and people; as a consequence, many coastal cities become increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of severe weather events and global climate change (<a href="#Walsh2011">Walsh et al. 2011</a>). Insight into the resilience of these urban systems and the effects of failing infrastructure in such events is crucial to the understanding of a city’s ability to adapt to climate change (<a href="Rosenzweig2011">Rosenzweig 2011</a>). This knowledge is particularly significant in the developing nations of Southeast Asia, which are expected to experience the greatest impacts of climate change, yet are often unable to make informed, evidence-based decisions concerning infrastructure and urban planning due to a lack of resources and an absence of reliable or consistent data (<a href="#Paar2011">Paar & Rekittke 2011</a>).</p>
        <p class="subsection">1.2.3 Regional Perspectives on Social Media</p>
        <p class="paper">The rise of social media platforms has taken city planners by surprise because these technologies not only provide unprecedented volumes of data relevant to the analysis of urban systems, but, more fundamentally, they change the way residents interact with each other and with the city at large (<a href="Townsend2014">Townsend 2014</a>). As first adopters continue to expedite the uptake of social media in Asian megacities, it is imperative to understand how to best harness the power of networked communication technologies to overcome urban challenges that result from climate change. Because geospatial information derived from social media is especially valuable and actionable within dense urban environments with a high proportion of networked users, Asian megacities facing the combined challenge of rapid development and climate change are critical sites for the development of new OSS that can turn the noise of social media into intelligent, actionable insights for users and governments alike.</p>

        <h4>1.3 Infrastructure Overview in Indonesia</h4>
        <p class="subsection">1.3.1 Jakarta’s Flood Infrastructure: A General History</p>
        <p class="paper">Seasonal flooding has been a part of life in Jakarta since the seventeenth century. By 1850, the Dutch colonial government finally took action and established the Burgelijke Openbare Werke, a task force responsible for flooding in the colonial city of Batavia. Following the major flood of 1918, an integrated master plan was designed to prevent further flooding; the West Flood Canal was built under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Herman van Breen. Later, under Soekarno’s administration, Waduk Pluit, Waduk Setiabudi, Waduk Tomang and Waduk Grogol were all successfully constructed as part of Kopro Banjir project. Following these infrastructural measures to combat flooding, Soeharto then planned to widen the canal in 1973, but the project failed to launch. Instead, the central government and local governments built the Cengkareng Drainage System as a flood control network that was finished a decade later. Despite these efforts, the flood infrastructure was unable to protect Jakarta as major floods paralyzed the city in 1979, 1996, 1999 and 2002. The Indonesian government, under Megawati’s administration, initiated the East Flood Canal as an extension of the original design by van Breen; its construction was completed under Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s government, costing over 4.9 trillion Rupiah (US$ 373 million). Notably, as in many other countries hit by the 1997 financial crisis, Indonesia’s infrastructure has also suffered from underinvestment for over a decade; flood management infrastructure has been seriously affected.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paper">The most recent strategy employed to fight flooding, initiated by the central government, is the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development program (NCICD). NCICD is supported by the government of The Netherlands, DKI Jakarta, and the government of Indonesia. The plan is to create an outer sea wall, the investment costs for which will be recovered by selling properties of a new waterfront city built on reclaimed land (<a href="#NCICD2014">NCICD 2014</a>). The NCICD project, also known colloquially as Great Garuda Sea Wall, has attracted various controversies (<a href="#Noviansyah2015">Noviansyah 2015</a>). Some see this solution as too profit-oriented and argue that the sea wall would lead to a “giant sewerage system” given that rivers and canals are highly polluted and would effectively drain the sewage of millions of residents into a giant retention pond on the coast, behind the proposed sea wall. There are also criticisms regarding the possible damage to the local marine ecology and fisheries, as seen during the development of the Saemangeum Sea Wall in South Korea (<a href="#Lighthouse2006">Lighthouse Foundation 2006</a>). In addition, many in the public doubt the feasibility of the project as Public Private Partnership (PPP) because such schemes are relatively new in Indonesia, and because the country has seen numerous infrastructure failures due to poor project execution and corruption (<a href="#Noviansyah2015">Noviansyah 2015</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">The Jakarta government is also currently undertaking a “Normalization” project aimed at increasing the drainage capacity of waterways, such as Ciliwung River. The project will displace over 34,000 families living along the river bank and widen Ciliwung river to almost double its natural width (<a href="#Rujak2008">Rujak Center 2008</a>). The measurement of sedimentation in surrounding channels and the Ciliwung River suggests that normalization could damage ecology and fisheries in ways similar to that of the Saemangeum Sea Wall in South Korea (<a href="#Smith2015">Smith 2015</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">As the population of Jakarta, and the surrounding area of Jabodetabek, continues to  expand, the impacts of flooding are significantly heightened. The 1996 flood forced 30,000 people to evacuate; the flood in 2007 inundated houses of 320,000 residents and claimed the lives of 80 people (<a href="#Taufik2014">Taufik 2014</a>). At present, 72.7% of Jakarta is prone to flooding (<a href="#Rostanti2012">Rostanti 2014</a>), threatening the lives of over 983,399 residents, or 10.2% of Jakarta’s population, with residents in North Jakarta facing the highest risk (<a href="#Rostanti2012">Rostanti 2014</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">Although Jakarta is the main urban area affected by flooding, the hydrological problem can be traced all the way to Bogor, 60 kilometers south of Jakarta. There are 13 major rivers running through Jakarta; most of these rivers originate in the mountainous areas of Bogor. Regrettably, the natural catchment areas of Bogor are decreasing due to weak land use policy enforcement. For example, based on Regional Regulation No. 19 / 2008, Kampung Sukatani is a conservation area and therefore construction in this area is prohibited; however, Kampung Sukatani has been transformed into an area of extremely luxurious residences. The villas were forcefully demolished by the Bogor government (with funding from the Jakarta government) in 2013, only to be rebuilt again two years later (<a href="#Rahmawati2015">Rahmawati 2015</a>). Examples like these show the need for an enduring commitment on the part of the governments of Bogor and Jakarta to manage the root causes of flooding upstream, where land use changes have serious effects on the ability of the downstream hydrological system to cope with the annual monsoon rains.</p>
        <p class="subsection">1.3.2 The Future of Flood Infrastructure in Jakarta</p>
        <p class="paper">The history of investment in flood infrastructure in Jakarta tends to suggest that new infrastructure rarely guarantees a reasonable cost-benefit analysis; research also suggests that the government should commit to a thorough analysis of all existing facilities and assets to develop an operational overview, in addition to investing in new infrastructure and additional maintenance. In the 2014 Regional Budget, the government allocated as little as 0.0153%, or 750 billion IDR, for flood control systems and drainage maintenance. With such a modest investment in the maintenance of critical flood infrastructure, it is not surprising that before monsoon season of 2012, for example, it was discovered that 141 out of 555 pumps in Jakarta were not operational (<a href="#Kompas2014">Kompas 2014</a>). While infrastructure asset analysis is a relatively novel science, it is nevertheless critical for the Jakarta government to devote resources to assessments and maintenance in order to determine the current state of flood control infrastructure and to make evidence-based, targeted investments in new facilities that can reduce risk in the weakest aspects of the current system. Because infrastructure facilities do not exist individually and are highly interdependent (<a href="#Ebrahimy2014">Ebrahimy 2014</a>; <a href="#Tran2014">Tran et al. 2014</a>), functional failures in one flood management facility can make any attempt to add new components to the system difficult to plan. Decisions regarding critical flood infrastructure investment should be evidence-based and rely on an understanding of critical interdependencies, energy demands, and an integrated assessment of needs in all related sectors because infrastructure interdependencies bring with them layers of complexity, uncertainty, and risk to urban planning and design (<a href="#Tran2014">Tran et al. 2014</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">From one administration to another, the most common approach toward flood infrastructure in Jakarta is to focus on new physical construction. Not only are these ventures capital intensive, but projects with large construction budgets are also prone to corruption (<a href="#Yanto2010">Yanto, 2010</a>). Currently, information and communication technologies (ICT) are a neglected dimension of flood management infrastructure. With such a high rate of mobile phone penetration, and exceedingly high rates of social media usage, the Jakarta government is well-positioned to encourage greater public participation in infrastructure monitoring and flood event reporting; these elements of civic co-management could help alleviate much of the burden currently carried borne solely by the government. However, such an approach requires a new vision of infrastructure that goes beyond canals and pumps, and begins to approach the question of flood management from a holistic view that includes ICT and public utilities for flood reporting.</p>
        <p class="paper">As a compliment to increased ICT investment, open data allows universal participation where data is available as a whole and and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost. By providing data under terms that permit reuse and redistribution, including intermixing with other datasets, citizen-users, NGOs, student and advocacy groups, and private developers can generate new tools for information management within the application economy. One excellent example of a government innovation to promote open data is the recently released SmartCity Jakarta website, with its applications Qlue (public) and Crop (government use only). Further investment in projects like SmartCity Jakarta, and the API-enabled data they produce, would be a welcome element to the DRM information ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>2.0 Computational Architectures for Big Crowdsourcing</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="paper">Jakarta has one of the highest concentration of Twitter users worldwide (<a href="#Semiocast2012">Semiocast, 2012</a>), and experiences severe seasonal flooding (Hartono et al., 2010). The tacit knowledge of local communities, government agencies, and first responders in Jakarta, as well as the dense network of mobile sensors connected via social media, provides a data source of unprecedented resolution for mitigating urban risk. In the context of DRM, the challenge for  information and communication technologies is not to develop new sensors or additional applications for crowd-sourcing data collection, but instead to seed the evolution of social media networks as a mega-city methodology for resilience to extreme weather events and climate change. This section explores the development of PetaJakarta.org and its underlying software CogniCity as a Geosocial Inteligence Framework for civic co-management during periods of flooding in Jakarta throughout the 2014-2015 monsoon season.</p>

        <h4>2.1 CogniCity: A GeoSocial Intelligence Framework for Urban Data</h4>
        <p class="paper">CogniCity is an open source framework for urban data, which harnesses the power of social media by gathering, sorting and displaying real-time situational reports from urgent infrastructure issues such as flooding. The CogniCity toolset, first trialed through the PetaJakarta.org pilot study, makes crowd-sourced information available in real-time to citizens in need of daily information, and to government agencies to support decision making using a strategy of civic co-management. CogniCity builds on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) theory, to gather citizen reports from the social media network Twitter and create geospatial visualisations of this information [<a href="#fig04">Fig. 04</a>]. However, CogniCity extends the traditional GIS paradigm to facilitate the process of citizen Twitter reporting by programmatically sending “invitation tweets” to users in the city who use the keyword “banjir” (flood). Reports are collected in a centralised geospatial database, and served via a data API to a client-side rendered map showing activity across the city in real-time, or as a data layer within external organisation geographical information systems [<a href="#fig04">Fig. 04</a>].</p>

        <h4>2.2 CogniCity: System Requirements & Design</h4>
        <p class="paper">CogniCity was conceived in response to system testing during a flood event in Jakarta on 5 February 2014, which captured 150,000 tweets in Jakarta related to flooding in a 24 hour period [<a href="#tab01">Table 01</a>]. This test was conducted using a proof-of-concept, rapid prototype NodeJS application, connected to the public Twitter Stream application programming interface (API), filtering tweets by location and keyword. The keywords included: banjir (‘flood’), tinggi (‘high’), genangan (‘pool’) and terendam (‘submerged’). The captured data revealed a user/tweet ratio of an average 1.5 per tweets per user, suggesting a wide distribution of users in conversation during this period [<a href="#tab01">Table 01</a>]. Furthermore the test revealed that a little over three percent of the captured tweets had precise coordinate-level geolocation metadata attached.</p>

        <p class="paper">The results of the system testing in February 2014 suggested that there was significant opportunity to crowd-source reports of flooding from Jakarta’s citizens via Twitter. The tests also showed that the use of words other than ‘flood’ or ‘banjir’ included a high number of tweets not relevant to flooding. As a result, for the 2014/2015 monsoon season, it was decided to only use these two keywords.</p>
        <p class="paper">The findings from the system testing were subsequently verified by the award of a Twitter #DataGrant, which made it possible to demonstrate both the spatial and temporal coverage of Twitter activity in relation to flooding in the city of Jakarta. <a href="#fig05">Fig. 05</a> shows geolocated tweets from the Twitter #DataGrant archive, awarded to the University of Wollongong, related to flooding over the entire 2013/2014 monsoon season. The spatial continuity and geographical coverage of Twitter data during flooding was revealed by the #DataGrant, with over 150,000 geolocated Twitter conversations observed in Jakarta during the 2013/2014 monsoon season. The #DataGrant highlighted the heterogeneity of Jakarta’s online citizens and supported the development of a real-time platform to map reports of flooding using Twitter. It is interesting to note that <a href="#fig05">Fig. 05</a> also shows underlying urban infrastructure (roads, transport interchanges, airports) derived solely from the locations of Jakarta’s citizens Tweeting from their mobile devices. The geographical extents for PetaJakarta.org were based on the #DataGrant [<a href="#fig05">Fig. 05</a>], and further design parameters for CogniCity were subsequently derived in an empirical manner based on the results of the system test and Twitter #DataGrant analysis. Each of the key design requirements is discussed below.</p>

        <!--2.2.1-->
        <p class="subsection">2.2.1 Networked Interfaces for Civic Co-Management</p>
        <p class="paper">One of the challenges facing decision makers using citizen reports for DRM is the verification of submitted information, particularly if this information has been harvested from social media in a passive manner (i.e. without direct contributions from users). Previously verification has been undertaken manually, a time consuming and labour intensive task. In situations where crowd-sourced reports are the primary source of information during a disaster, the classification of reports as verified or not is of critical importance to ensure that decision makers and the public are only interpreting data which is directly relevant to the situation. Filtering approaches are often adapted to a DRM context from existing practices in information theory, where outlying data is removed as a matter of routine  (<a href="#Medina2011">Medina 2011</a>).</p>
        <p class="paper">To address these issues, previous DRM projects have used online communities to outsource human analysis of reports in order to classify their validity, and even rank their importance, forming online international communities of digital humanitarians (<a href="#Meier2014">Meier 2014</a>). The large volume of data captured during the system testing, and corroborated by the Twitter #DataGrant, necessitated that PetaJakarta.org develop a new solution to collect verified reports of flooding directly from Jakarta’s citizens, reducing the requirements for manual verification or intensive computation analysis through machine-learning methods. Only in this way was it possible to provide a situational overview for decision makers and the public in a real-time manner. This approach builds on previous crowdsourcing efforts in response to natural disasters that relied on a people-centric approach to gather local knowledge, translate, and classify information (<a href="#Holderness2014">Holderness 2014</a>; <a href="#Meier2014">Meier 2014</a>), tasks which are challenging to automate and computerize.</p>
        <p class="paper">Through the PetaJakarta.org platform, the OSS CogniCity used the social media platform Twitter to engage citizens and form a network of ground truth reports about the flood condition. In this “people-as-sensors” paradigm, Twitter users within the system parameters (e.g. geographic location, discussing flooding) were invited to confirm whether flooding was taking place at their location. Users could then see the results of their contributions, as well as those of other citizens, visualised on a map linked to their network (Twitter), in the public domain and in real-time. The map used by both the public and government agencies thus created a two-way communication interface between users, PetaJakarta.org, and the government. Importantly, users were offered the opportunity to report by text or media in an unrestricted manner (within the confines of Twitter platform) on the given situation, a method which has been historically proven as more effective at providing reliable data than crowd-sourced requests for highly structured reports (<a href="#Coen2012">Coen 2012</a>). In this manner, PetaJakarta.org formed a self-evolving network of reporters, who through their engagement with the project, the platform, and each other, shared information and refined their reports during the course of monsoon season. This process is evident in the typologies of reports generated by users, developed through a process of communicative evolution, which is further described in Section 3.3.</p>
        <p class="paper">The process of soliciting active validation from citizen reports was a two-step process; first, users in the city who included the keyword banjir (or ‘flood’ in English) in a public conversation on Twitter were sent an invitation to verify whether they were experiencing flooding. Second, the user was able to verify flooding simply by replying to the invitation—that is, by sending a Tweet to the @petajkt account containing the keyword ‘flood’ or ‘banjir,’ and including geolocation metadata enabled by the Twitter application on mobile devices.</p>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org became one of the first projects in the world to programatically invite users to participate in a crowd-sourcing effort using Twitter. Whilst existing infrastructure exists within the Twitter platform to disseminate specific messages to a targeted audience (e.g. through promoted tweets), through this world-first collaboration with Twitter, PetaJakarta.org was able to send every user in Jakarta who mentioned the keyword ‘flood’ or ‘banjir’ during the monsoon season an invititation to confirm the flood situation via a Twitter; these reports were automatically added to the publically available PetaJakarta.org map. The design of the automated invitation and related outreach campaign are discussed in detail in Section 3. Over the course of the 2014/2015 monsoon, PetaJakarata.org sent 89,000 invitations to citizens in Jakarta as a call to action to confirm flood conditions, gaining over two million Twitter impressions over the same period as a result. The results and an evaluation of this process are discussed further in Section 5.1 below.</p>

        <!--2.2.2-->
        <p class="subsection">2.2.2 Real-Time Multi-stable Platform</p>
        <p class="paper">The key requirement of the interface for the flood reports was the provision of data in a manner accessible to the project stakeholders: the general public and the government of Jakarta. The interface needed to provide actionable information both for decision makers operating at the city scale (e.g. BPBD DKI; Office of the Governor DKI Jakarta, SmartCity Jakarta) and for the public at neighbourhood and street scales. Importantly, these outputs could not be divided into separate products; to allow for transparency between decision makers and users, both groups needed to reference the same map with the same data. To overcome this challenge, the web-map at PetaJakarta.org drew on web-based GIS and web design development to create one interface which was optimized depending on the client device used [<a href="#fig06">Fig. 06</a>]. When viewed on a desktop computer, the web-application scaled the map to show a situational overview of the city. In this mode, CogniCity generates an on-the-fly thematic choropleth representation of the number of reports per administrative area. These choropleth layers were available at one, three, or six hour intervals to match the temporality of the government’s existing internal reporting structure and decision-making processes. Section 4 discusses BPBD DKI Jakarta’s existing practices and information structures relevant to PetaJakarta.org.</p>
        <p class="paper">In contrast, when viewed on a mobile device, the application scaled the web-map to show the reports at the neighbourhood scale over the past hour only [<a href="#fig06">Fig. 06</a>]. If provided with geolocation data from the user's’ mobile device, the map orientates itself to the user’s location and shows the reports in the immediate vicinity. Based on Tobler’s first law of geography (<a href="#Tobler1970">Tobler 1970</a>), it was assumed that in a DRM context the closest and most recent reports would be of most relevance to the user, enabling the map itself to act as a spatio-temporal filter. In effect, the goal was to distil the Tweet reports on a per-user basis so as to minimise the possibility of overwhelming the user with a larger number of reports while still providing relevant and actionable information.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org created a user-centric, multi-stable cartographic interface with the aim of providing actionable information to both the government and public. These groups operate at different spatial and temporal scales. However, in the interest of transparency, the same interface needed to be accessible by both user groups. Furthermore, the development of the map through a web-interface suitable for both desktop and mobile devices was key to ensuring the widest possible accessibility and reducing the adoption thresholds to PetaJakarta.org, in contrast to platform specific applications (‘apps’). The effectiveness of a user-centric, multi-stable cartographic interface to the data is discussed further in Section 5.1.</p>

        <!--2.2.3-->
        <p class="subsection">2.2.3 Scale-able Geospatial Information System</p>
        <p class="paper">CogniCity operates a web-based geographic information system using a client-server model. A request is issued by the client device for relevant data, such as the number of tweets per municipal area for the past hour. This request is received by the CogniCity server module, computed in real-time, and returned to the client (i.e. PetaJakarta.org). Rendering of the data on the map interface is the completed on the client device. This structure of the IT architecture was adopted for two reasons; first, so that CogniCity can provide streams of geospatial data in real-time which can be used by any client, not just PetaJakarta.org. Second, rendering data on the client device reduces the computational overhead of server processes, and negates the need for the server to generate image based map tiles, which would be computationally-intensive to achieve in near-real time. In this configuration, CogniCity becomes extremely scaleable and affords the opportunity to use cloud services to perform load balancing and on-the-fly server creation to help distribute the load of large numbers of client requests.</p>
        <p class="paper">CogniCity provides data to the web-interface by means of a geospatial Application Programming Interface (API), operating in a RESTFul manner. The API provides Uniform Resource Locator end-points to current and archived locations of flood reports, aggregate counts of activity over time, and hydrological infrastructure layers. Client-side JavaScript is then used to connect to and request data from these endpoints when the user loads the map. Data is delivered using the GeoJSON format, or optionally the compressed TopoJSON format to reduce the volumes of data from CogniCity server to client. One of the key requirements of structuring the architecture in this way—using a client-server model—was to support the consumption of the data within the DRM information ecosystem, beyond of the standard PetaJakarta.org interface. The open source Quantum GIS Platform is widely used to assist DRM in Southeast Asia and supports loading of geospatial data using web protocols in the GeoJSON format. As such, data stored within CogniCity for the PetaJakarta.org project can be loaded into QGIS, helping to support the use of this data by decision makers (e.g. BPBD DKI) within their existing GIS infrastructure. The technical specification of the CogniCity API is discussed below in Section 2.3.3.</p>
        <p class="paper">CogniCity is capable of collecting data from either the Twitter Public Stream API or the commercially-available Twitter PowerTrack product [<a href="#fig02">Fig. 02</a>]. The Public Stream API is suitable for lower volume applications, which expect a fewer number of Tweets. However, in relation to PetaJakarta.org, the advantages of using PowerTrack over the public API were threefold: 1) the PowerTrack API provides access to all relevant tweets and is not subject to rate limiting, whereas the public API is limited; 2) PowerTrack hosts advanced filtering functionality, to search for keyword terms (e.g. ‘banjir’), reducing computational overhead for local filtering of tweets, as compared to using the Public Stream API; 3) The PowerTrack API includes advanced connection monitoring and technical support, helping to reduce local monitoring requirements and facilitating a stable connection and data-flow.</p>
        <p class="paper">In contrast to the incoming data, programmatic invitation tweets are sent out via CogniCity using the public Twitter REST API [<a href="#fig07">Fig. 07</a>]. The connection to this API was perfomed using the credentials of the verified @petajkt Twitter account, with support from Twitter, who removed the limits on the number of tweets which could be sent from the account to enable the automated delivery of high-volumes of invitation messages.</p>
        <p class="paper">In reviewing the proposed design following the system testing in January 2014, user anonymity in the reporting process was embedded within CogniCity and PetaJakarta.org system. Whilst the data produced by Twitter reports of flooding is in the public domain (albeit with the restriction of registering as a Twitter user), the objective of PetaJakarta.org (and CogniCity) was not to create an archive of users who submitted potentially sensitive reports about flooding events, outside of the Twitter platform. In addition to privacy issues related to the collecting and storing information about individual users, the Twitter development guidelines specifically call for respect of the user’s privacy. For these reasons, CogniCity was designed, as part of its original specification, to anonymise reports collected by separating reports from their respective users. Furthermore, the text content of tweets is only stored when the report is confirmed, that is, when the user has opted to send a message to the @petajkt account to describe their situation. Similarly, when usernames are stored, they are encrypted using a one-way hash function. The open source nature of CogniCity is a key design factor in this respect. Publicly sharing the source code means that anyone can examine the software to see how unconfirmed reports are discarded and how the one-way encryption process of usernames operates. Through an interrogation of the code, it is possible to see CogniCity’s objective of creating derivative geospatial products based on Twitter data, which contain actionable information for the public and government in response to flooding.</p>

        <a id="2.3" class="anchor"></a>
        <h4>2.3 Technical Specifications</h4>

        <p class="paper">CogniCity is organised into four components [<a href="#fig07">Fig. 07</a>]; the ‘Reports’ module is responsible for collecting data from Twitter and sending invitation tweets. The ‘Server’ module provides the real-time data API, and serves the third component, the ‘Client Interface’ (PetaJakarta.org), which provides access and visualisation to the data. The final component is the CogniCity database, which underpins the entire CogniCity software stack. The database runs on the open source PostgreSQL object-relational database management system and uses the PostGIS extension to support geospatial data, including the locations of Tweet reports. For the 2014/2015 monsoon season, the reports module, the server module, and the database were deployed operationally in the cloud using Amazon Web Services. All of the cloud instances were located in Amazon’s Singapore datacentre to reduce latency for the target audience located in Jakarta. The following section describes each of the modules and their technical specifications. Following this, Section 2.3.5 provides an overview of the corresponding metadata catalogue, and the PetaJakarta.org Major Open Data Collection from the data collected during the 2014/2015 monsoon season. References for CogniCity’s source code and documentation are included in Appendix I.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="subsection">2.3.1 CogniCity Database</p>
        <p class="paper">The CogniCity database is comprised of 14 database tables [summarised in Appendix II], populated by the flood reports created from the tweets received by the CogniCity Reports Module [<a href="#fig05">Fig. 05</a>]. All tables are independent of each other, except for the ‘all_users’ table which is populated by a trigger function each time an entry is added to the ‘tweet_invitees,’ ‘tweet_users,’ or ‘nonspatial_tweet_users’ tables by CogniCity Reports. The entry of data into the database by the Reports module, and retrieval of information by the Server module, is discussed below in sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, respectively.</p>
        <p class="subsection">2.3.2 CogniCity Reports Module</p>
        <p class="paper">The Reports module is CogniCity’s interface to Twitter. The module collects relevant tweets, adding them to the database as flood reports, and sends tweets to users inviting them to confirm the current flood condition. CogniCity divides Tweets about flooding into two categories; unconfirmed reports are Tweets from Jakarta, with geo-location metadata, that contain the specific keyword ‘flood’ or ‘banjir.’ Keywords can be either a hashtag (e.g. #banjir), or part of the tweet text (e.g. ‘Jakarta is flooding’). These reports are added to the database table ‘tweet_reports_unconfirmed’ [Appendix II], and subsequently added to the map. However, as these reports are unconfirmed (e.g. the tweet could refer to a different point in time or location), only the geolocation metadata of the Tweet is stored in the database. Upon receipt of an unconfirmed report, the Reports module programmatically sends the user a Tweet in reply, inviting them to confirm the situation. Once a user has been sent an invitation, their username is hashed using a one way encryption function and added to the ‘tweet_invitees’ database table. This ensures that a user never receives more than one programmatically-generated invitation Tweet; before each invitation is sent, the username is compared against the existing list in the database.</p>
        <p class="paper"><a href="#fig08">Fig. 08</a> shows an unconfirmed report, detected by the CogniCity Reports module, which then issues an automated invitation Tweet to the user. The invitation message aims to inform the user about the project and provide instructions on how to submit a confirmed report. The invitation Tweet is limited to 109 characters to allow for Twitter usernames in the reply; however, by using Twitter Cards, the automated Tweet could also contain a short embedded video which explained the project and how to participate. The design of the video is discussed further in Section 3.2.2. Invitation Tweets were either sent in English or Bahasa Indonesian depending on the language as defined in the metadata of the tweet (unconfirmed report) received by CogniCity:</p>

        <!--Auto message callouts x2-->
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Flooding? Enable geo-location, tweet @petajkt #banjir and check petajakarta.org”</p>
          <footer>CogniCity Invitation Tweet sent from <cite>@petajkt</cite> in English</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Kena banjir? Aktifkan geolokasi. Laporkan ke @petajkt #banjir. Cek di petajakarta.org"</p>
          <footer>CogniCity Invitation Tweet sent from <cite>@petajkt</cite> in Bahasa Indonesian</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="paper"><a href="#fig08">Fig. 08</a> also shows the user’s response to the programmatic invitation Tweet, in the form of a confirmed report containing a photo of the flood condition, approximate height of the flood waters, and user’s location by ‘Rukun-Warga’ (RW) and ‘Rukun-Warga’ (RT) municipal boundary numbers. Upon receipt of a confirmed report as shown in <a href="#fig08">Fig. 08</a>, the Reports module adds the Tweet, text, and geolocation metadata to the ‘tweet_reports’ database table, enabling the report to be plotted on the map at PetaJakarta.org. The hashed version of the username is then added to ‘tweet_users’ table. Finally, the CogniCity generates a thank you message confirming the receipt of the user’s report and directing them to PetaJakarta.org to see their contribution to the map. <a href="#fig09">Fig. 09</a> shows the process of CogniCity managing incoming Tweets, classifying them as confirmed or unconfirmed, and issuing the required response.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paper">In addition to confirmed and unconfirmed reports, two other conditions may arise on receipt of tweets by the Reports module. If a confirmed report (i.e. sent to ‘@petajkt’) is received but without the required geo-location metadata to be added to the map it is entered into the ‘nonspatial_tweet_reports’ database table, and a count of users is kept in the ‘non_spatial_tweet_users’ table [Appendix II]. Upon receipt of such a Tweet, CogniCity programmatically sends the user a reminder to enable geolocation and try submitting the report again [<a href="#fig09">Fig. 09</a>]. Unlike unconfirmed Tweets, no username check is carried out prior to sending a geolocation reminder, as the user has opted to include the PetaJakarta.org account ‘@petajkt’ in their Tweet. This strategy was designed so as to not limit the number of reminders sent to help increase the use of geolocation, and as such the number of confirmed reports received. The CogniCity Reports module stores a blacklist of official user accounts such as BPBD DKI Jakarta, who regularly send tweets without geolocation metadata (i.e. from their Incident Control Room), to prevent these accounts from receiving continuous reminders to enable geolocation on their Tweets.</p>

        <!--Figure 09-->
        <a id="fig09" class="anchor"></a>

        </div>

        <p class="paper"><a href="#fig09">Fig. 09</a> also shows shows the process when an unconfirmed tweet is received without geo-location data. As the system testing suggested that this would represent the majority of tweets [Table 01], before being discarded CogniCity checks the location parameter of the user profile metadata in the tweet for the key word ‘Jakarta,’ suggesting the user is a resident in the city. If present, the user receives a programmatic invite as per an unconfirmed invitation; if not, then the Tweet is disregarded by CogniCity.</p>
        <p class="paper">As described in Section 2.2 above, the system testing from February 2014 showed 5,000 tweets over a single day which could potentially be classified as unconfirmed reports, albeit with the six keywords, instead of only “flood” and “banjir” as used for the 2014/2015 monsoon season. To assess the CogniCity Reports module prior to deployment, the system was load-tested using both data from the Twitter #DataGrant and Twitter PowerTrack. At maximum throughput, CogniCity is capable of handling up to 250 tweets per second, with the complete processing of each tweet including classification, writing to the database, and sending of automated replies taking 30 milliseconds, although these values are subject to the platform on which CogniCity is deployed operationally. During operation, errors such as disconnections from the PowerTrack API or the database server are logged and the module attempts to reconnect at specified intervals. Within a five minute window, any missing data is recovered using the PowerTrack backfill functionality, and loss of connection to the CogniCity database results in internal caching in CogniCity Reports until the database connection is restored. Any exceptions which go unhandled result in a notification Tweet being sent to the CogniCity system administrators.</p>
        <p class="subsection">2.3.3 CogniCity Server Module and Database Design</p>
        <p class="paper">The server module is a custom NodeJS application tasked with providing the API-based data on the reports stored in the CogniCity database. The server module also serves the static components of the client interface (i.e. the PetaJakarta.org website), using the Express framework within NodeJS.</p>
        <p class="paper">The server module provides access to three groups of data across nine API endpoints [Appendix III]. The reports endpoint provides real-time (i.e. last hour) listing of confirmed and unconfirmed reports, and their geolocation metadata. The aggregates endpoint provides real-time counts of the sum of confirmed and unconfirmed reports from the past one, three, six or 24 hour periods at three different municipal scales. The municipal scale is specified by the client when requesting data and includes the city scale (i.e. the five cities of Jakarta), sub-district scale (i.e. ‘Kecamatan’), village scale (i.e. ‘Kelurahan’), and RW scale (‘Rukun-Warga’). Lastly, the infrastructure endpoint provides access to data representing the location of waterways, pumps, and floodgates in Jakarta, used by PetaJakarta.org as contextual support for the real-time flood map. CogniCity serves the endpoints under the domain of the web interface (i.e. PetaJakarta.org). For example, to access counts of reports from the last hour, the client makes a request to the following URL <a href="http://petajakarta.org/banjir/data/api/v1/aggregates/live" target="_blank">http://petajakarta.org/banjir/data/api/v1/aggregates/live</a>. For references to complete API documentation for each of the endpoints, consult Appendix III.</p>
        <p class="paper">Apart from the report-count and report-time series endpoints, all endpoints provide data in the GeoJSON format by default. This provides the data in a format which is readable by the PetaJakarta.org map library LeafletJS and by the open source GIS platform QGIS used by BPBD DKI Jakarta. Optionally, the client can request the data in the TopoJSON format, which is a compressed representation of GeoJSON data. TopoJSON reduces data volume by employing a topological representation to minimise the number of geometric vertices and edges which are required to represent vector geometries. PetaJakarta.org used the TopoJSON library to compress geometries served by the data API, which are then uncompressed (converted back to GeoJSON) on the client. During testing, the TopoJSON format reduced data volumes by 85% and associated data transfer speeds by a third, helping to improve performance of PetaJakarta.org, especially on mobile devices.</p>
        <p class="paper">To further improve responsiveness of the map when loading data, each of the endpoint requests is cached in computer memory by the CogniCity server application for sixty seconds. This ensures that users are provided with data in real-time, which is no more than sixty seconds old, but reduces the number of individual database queries executed if a large number of users logon to PetaJakarta.org simultaneously. This architecture is particularly relevant for the aggregates layers, which are computed on-the-fly after a request to an aggregates endpoint is received in order to reduce database volume. Whilst this creates increased workload for the database, it reduces database size, removes the need for periodic calculations of aggregates, and ensures that the aggregates data is real-time. The spatial computation of how many tweets are within a specific municipal district at a given time is achieved using a spatial SQL query embedded within the server module. The query uses the PostGIS function ‘ST_Within’ to aggregate and count tweets in the reports and unconfirmed reports tables, with the polygon table of the municipal district scale requested [see Appendix II for listing of CogniCity Database tables]. The process is optimised by employing a Generalized Search Tree (“GIST”) Index on the geometry column for all spatial tables in the database. Furthermore, the unique ID for each polygon geometry at the RW scale is the same primary key system used by BPBD DKI Jakarta, ensuring inter-operability for PetaJakarta.org data with applications within the existing DRM information ecosystem in Jakarta, such as the InaSAFE planning tool, built by AIFDR. As such, the PetaJakarta.org aggregate layers, generated by CogniCity, could be used as hazard exposure layers for future flood mitigation and adaption planning in Jakarta.</p>
        <p class="subsection">2.3.4 PetaJakarta.org Map Interface</p>
        <p class="paper">The interactive map at PetaJakarta.org was built using the Leaflet JavaScript library with real-time data provided from the CogniCity API. Through the development of the client-side ‘map.js’ JavaScript module, as part of CogniCity, PetaJakarta.org provided a multi-stable cartographic interface for flood reports. Users are divided into two groups: devices with a touch screen are classed as ‘mobile’ (i.e. smartphones and tablets), and those without are referred to as ‘desktop’ devices (i.e. laptops and desktop computers).</p>
        <p class="paper">For mobile users, confirmed and unconfirmed reports of flooding were added to the map in point form. This cartographic symbology simplified the interface on small screens and reduced the volume of data required when loading the map. Additionally, mobile users only saw the reports from within the last hour, whereas desktop users had the option of seeing aggregate data from the past one, three, or six hours.</p>
        <p class="paper">Mobile device users were asked to share their location with PetaJakarta.org, which, if granted, zooms the map to the device’s location, showing the reports in the user’s immediate vicinity. <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a> shows a screen capture of the map on a mobile device in November 2014; the user’s location is denoted by the blue pin, and five unconfirmed reports are visible on the map.</p>

        <!--Figure 10-->

        </div>

        <p class="paper">Clicking on a confirmed report allowed the user to see the contents of the original tweet, and any included media are hyperlinked back to the Twitter platform. The text from unconfirmed reports is not retained by CogniCity (see Section 2.2.3); instead, the popup for unconfirmed reports contained instructions on how to send a confirmed report via Twitter. If geolocation was not available, or the user was outside of Jakarta, then the map rendered a view of reports at the city scale as shown in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>. Additionally, to help with user navigation of the data, the map also included a reports tool which shows a listing of confirmed reports ordered by the most recent first. Referring to <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>, one sees that the reports module is notifying the user that there are currently four confirmed reports across the city, marked as blue dots on the map.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paper">Rendering of all data is carried out by the Leaflet library on the client. To facilitate a smooth interactive experience when using the map, all current confirmed and unconfirmed reports of flooding in Jakarta are downloaded onto the user’s device when the map is loaded. This enables the user to pan and zoom around the city to see reports beyond their immediate vicinity. The loading of large numbers of points (up to 1,000 during the 2014/2015 season) on mobile devices, over cellular data networks, was facilitated by using the TopoJSON library for geospatial data compression, and HTML5 Canvas layers as the default model for point rendering. Additionally, asynchronous loading of data from the CogniCity API means that the map is interactive before all the data have completed loading. As a result of these intergrated components, PetaJakarta.org provided a useable map, with reasonable performance, even when rending hundreds of reports on low-end touch-screen devices using a cellular data connection.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="paper">Desktop users viewed the same map, but instead of point representations of reports, users saw aggregate counts of reports in municipal areas across the entire city. This thematic choropleth symbology showed variations in intensity of twitter activity across the city. Primarily aimed at decision-makers such as BPBD DKI Jakarta, the aggregate interface also allowed users to drill down through the different spatial scales of municipal boundaries, with each layer showing the count of tweets at a finer grain resolution, until reaching street level where individual reports were displayed in a manner similar to the mobile user interface [<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>]. In this way, starting at the city-scale overview, a user could quickly identified hot-spots of activity with high numbers of reports. <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a> shows a screen capture of PetaJakarta.org from flooding in January 2015. Importantly, the desktop user could view the same data as the mobile user, but data were represented first in aggregate form to support decision-making at greater spatial and temporal scales than required by the general public. The only discrepancy between the two interfaces is that the bounding box of tweet capture in the CogniCity Reports module [see <a href="fig06">Fig. 06</a>] extends beyond that of the Jakarta boundary, meaning that the mobile user saw reports from a larger area than represented by the aggregate layers. However, both interfaces also include overlays of rivers, pumps and floodgates in Jakarta. These layers, which were optionally enabled on the map, enhance spatial navigation of the city by representing the urban infrastructure which makes up Jakarta’s hydrological and hydraulic network. It is anticipated that in the future this network data could be supplemented, for example, to tie reports of flooding to failures of specific infrastructure assets, thereby further enhancing the information available for decision-makers.</p>

        <p class="subsection">2.3.5 Metadata Records and the PetaJakarta.org Major Open Data Collection</p>
        <p class="paper">The PetaJakarta.org Major Open Data Collection (MODC) is an initiative supported by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). In addition to provision of the data via the CogniCity API at PetaJakarta.org, an archive of data from the 2014/2015 monsoon season is available under an open license to support further research. The MODC compliments the open source ethos of CogniCity and includes the aggregate counts of confirmed and unconfirmed reports at the ‘Rukun-Warga’ (RW) scale in hourly intervals, as well as the layers representing Jakarta’s hydrological network. As shown in <a href="#fig05">Fig. 05</a>, these data and their metadata are held in the University of Wollongong institutional repository, referenced by unique digital object identifiers (DOIs). Corresponding records for the data are kept in the National Library of Australia and the Research Data Australia Portal. Appendix IV contains further details of the metadata and links to their records.</p>

        <h4>2.4 Summary & Recommendations</h4>
        <p class="paper">In summary, through the PetaJakarta.org Joint Pilot Study, CogniCity has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of a web-based, open source, Geosocial Intelligence Framework as a tool to crowd-source geospatial information about flood activity in Jakarta. Using the NodeJS framework on top of a PostgreSQL database, it was possible to build a rapid prototype of a scalable geographic information system capable of capturing Twitter data and serving them through a web-map interface as confirmed and unconfirmed flood reports in real-time. NodeJS, combined with a scaleable cloud deployment proved to be a robust solution for such a system, capable of handing more than 3,000 user requests on PetaJakarta.org within an hour, and consuming upto 240 incoming tweets per second. Furthermore, the use of JavaScript to build the client-side interface using the Leaflet library combined with GeoJSON and TopoJSON data from the CogniCity API suggest that JavaScript is capable of acting as a unifying language for the rapid prototyping of high-volume, low-latency, web-based geospatial applications.</p>

        <h3>3.0 Civic Co-management: Citizen Perspectives</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="paper">PetaJakarta.org was used by residents of Jakarta to share flood information, call for support, and navigate the city during the seasonal monsoon. The following section provides a summary of the design parameters for the development of PetaJakarta.org as a user-centric platform, detailing the methodology and approach of designed engagement; the communication patterns and typology of reports is subsequently examined in detail; an overall summary and recommendations conclude the review of civic co-management from the citizen-user perspective.</p>

        <!--Figure 14.-->

        <a id="3.1" class="anchor"></a>
        <h4>3.1 User Experience & Interface</h4>

        <p class="subsection">3.1.1 Branding</p>
        <p class="paper">In developing the PetaJakarta.org brand as the public face of the project, it was important to ensure that the interface and map were presented as community-owned, rather than as a government product or academic research tool. This concern is directly related to the open source and open data ethos of the project; moreover, because the platform relied on public adoption, it needed to not only operate as a transparent, community-centric information sharing platform, but had to also feel like a community platform [Figs. 14 & 15].</p>

        <!--Figure 15-->

        <p class="paper">he design of community inclusion can be summarized effectively by three key objectives: (1) draw on existing platforms with similar crowd-sourced city engagement; (2) make compatible with the technology, OS, and resolutions most frequently used for web access; (3) enhance and highlight the crowd-sourced ‘ask’ for the users, and their incentives for participation. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>From a user-experience perspective,  commercial, crowd-sourced traffic applications (eg. Waze) share a similar logic of public participation; these applications studied in order to understand the expectations of features and language of map-based crowd-sourced tools. </li>
          <li>As many of the users were connecting via mobile devices to access both the Twitter platform and the website—with the emphasis on those using mobile GNSS to geo-locate flood reports and check nearby flood reports—the site and its graphic elements were designed to load quickly and legibly at low bandwidth and low resolution.</li>
          <li>The community-participation aspect of the project was communicated in a concise, action-oriented form in all of the media produced for the public. “See a flood? Tell us,” is the basic message used to indicate how the public should best engage with the project. The ‘big crowdsourcing’ element of the project was also highlighted in language and visuals (eg. “The more people use Peta Jakarta, the better the map will be”), indicating a user-centric incentive that also encouraged users to share information about the project with their own social media network by retweeting messages from the @petajkt account.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="paper">This branding strategy towards community inclusion can also be traced through individual design decisions, including the use of language, color, graphics, and the map interface itself. Aiming to appeal to first adopters—the young, tech-savvy Twitter-public of Jakarta—the language used in all the outreach materials (Twitter replies, the outreach video, graphics, and print advertisements) was intentionally casual and concise. In these communications, a direct action was always emphasised, for example, ‘turn on your phone’s geolocation,’ ‘tell us about it,’ or ‘report a flood’. Because of the repeated recurrence of flood events during the monsoon, and the continuation of daily activities around and through these flood events, the messages were intentionally designed to be more like normal twitter chatter and less like public service announcements. Geolocation pins with speech bubbles were used in advertisements to indicate the connection between the map and community expression of concern. The graphic style and color choices were similarly light and youthful, connecting visually to sites used as part of everyday life rather than as emergency response. [Fig. 15] Graphics and colors were also selected to ensure they were easily identifiable even on a small mobile device screen. A clean, black and white map background with brightly colored report pins was selected as the map interface so that its legibility was optimized on all screen resolutions.</p>

        <p class="subsection">3.1.2 Website</p>
        <p class="paper">Although much of the public engagement with the project occurs through the Twitter platform, the PetaJakarta.org website hosts the map interface and information about the project. As explained in Section 2.2.2, the map is both a tool for government and public access to real-time flood reports. From the perspective of the citizen-user, the emphasis was to provide easy access to the map and direct information on how to engage with the project. Thus, the public engagement with the project is divided into two actions: first, “share flood information” and second, “view the map.” . The website indicates these two actions on the homepage [Fig. 16], allowing the user to easily navigate to via either of these concise instructions to learn how to share information or proceed directly to the map. The PetaJakarta.org home page also includes an embedded copy of the Outreach Video in Bahasa Indonesian and English. The default language of the website is Bahasa Indonesian, allow a main navigation tab allows users to switch the platform to English.</p>
